Currently, there is no way for the different entities in the automotive industry supply chain to track the complete life cycle of an automotive, where the parts were manufactured, who supplied the materials, and how it reached one entity (i.e., who shipped it).

The project will solve the above-mentioned problem of the life cycle of automotives and it will keep track of the entities which were in possession of a specific part. Blockchain is a non-mutable database so it will not be possible to change a transaction once it occurs.
